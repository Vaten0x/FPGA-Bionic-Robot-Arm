# FPGA Bionic Robot Hand

## Overview

This project implements a fully 3D-printed robotic hand controlled by an FPGA (DE1-SoC) using Verilog. The system decodes microcoded gesture instructions and sends PWM signals to five servo motors that control finger movement. Unlike conventional microcontroller-based control, this setup demonstrates how low-level digital logic and hardware description languages can directly control physical systems, a strong demonstration of computer architecture and embedded design.

## Hardware Components

- **DE1-SoC FPGA Development Board**: Acts as the main controller, generating PWM signals in Verilog for each servo motor based on microcoded instruction decoding.
- **5V 30A 150W Power Supply**: Provides regulated power directly to all five servo motors to prevent brownouts and overheating during high torque loads.
- **HK-15298 Servo Motors**: Five servo motors drive the fingers of the robotic hand. (An additional wrist motor is included in hardware but unused in this prototype.)
- **Custom 3D-Printed Hand & Mechanical Claw**: Designed based on the InMoov open-source hand project.
- **PCA9685 Driver (Optional)**: Previously used with Raspberry Pi for testing, now bypassed in final FPGA-controlled version.
